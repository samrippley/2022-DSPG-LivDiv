The average of every household in our data set's weekly expenditure over time.

This graph shows the average total expenditure of each village over time. Each line represents one of the 10 villages.  

These graphs show expenditure 

Expenditure = total spending = weekly total consumption and non-consumption expenditures. 
consumption expenditure ex - food 
non consumption expenditure ex - rent 


This graph shows the average total expenditure of each village over time. Each line represents one of the 10 villages.
