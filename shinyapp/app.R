The area is intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats, and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests (which have above the ground roots or “breathing roots.”) The region also acts as a shelter belt to protect the inland from storms, cyclones, tidal surges, sea water seepage and soil erosion.

This was immediately followed by two more rounds of training. The intent of these training sessions was to prepare the households to independently record their financial activities in pre-printed diaries. The field team collected the baseline, along with four weeks of Financial Diaries during their trip.")

When India’s phase-I lockdown started on March 24th, 2020, questions about basic supplies and food were given to community leaders to gather more information.

The financial diaries consisted of many questions such as both male and female weekly household income, remittance, borrowing, lending, and expenditure on consumption and non-consumption items.")
