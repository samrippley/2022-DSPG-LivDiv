However, suppose this labor market has 100 coal miners and only 5 math teachers, then this assumption would be incorrect. If we consider the distribution of labor within occupations, we multiply each skill index for each occupation by the number of individuals employed in this occupation. For the hypothetical labor market, math teachers' weighted public speaking value is 0.95 x 5 = 4.75, and coal miners' weighted public speaking value is 0.1 x 100 = 10. Similarly, the weighted manual labor value for math teachers is 1.5, and for coal miners is 80. This community's raw public speaking skills index is 10 + 4.75 = 14.75, and the raw manual labor skills index is 81.5. The normalized or Public Speaking Skill Index is then 14.75/96.25 = .15, and for manual labor is 0.85.  For this community, the Skill indices show that manual labor with a value of 0.85 is much more prevalent than public speaking at 0.15 for this community."),

The skill prevalence index we construct does account for skill importance as well. Importance and proficiency are highly correlated in our data, but there are occupations where this differs. For example, consider a job that requires a low proficiency in typing even though typing is important because the employees must type a few things every week. We multiply the importance level by the proficiency necessary to compensate for some of these unusual occupations.  "),

This range suggests that for each PUMA in Appalachia, Technology Design skills are not the dominant skills needed for the occupations in that community relative to other skills in that community.  In other words there are very few jobs that require this skill in each PUMA. The highest prevalence of Technology Design skills is noted in PUMAs that contain large metro areas. For example, if you over over the yellow region on the map, a pop-up will show the Huntsville North and Madison East PUMA’s. This community has the highest prevalence of Technology Design Skills and it includes the city of Huntsville, AL which is the blue circle on the map.
